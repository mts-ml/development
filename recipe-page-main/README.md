### What I learned

This project had a lot of tags, so to facilitate CSS development, I wanted to use nesting. Since styled components and SCSS modules don't work in pure HTML/CSS projects, I did some research and found out that you can use Sass with HTML. You just need to configure the **package.json** file and run **yarn watch-css** in the terminal.
It helped a lot.

"Had to come back and fix some issues; I used an ```<h3>``` before an ```<h2>``` and learned that you need to follow the correct sequence.
In the Nutrition section, I initially used an ```<ul>``` instead of ```<table>```, but I've fixed it now.
I also corrected minor irregularities.
So, I learned more about HTML elements, the proper tags to use, and their order."
